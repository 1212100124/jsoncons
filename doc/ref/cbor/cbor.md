### cbor extension

The cbor extension implements encode to and decode from the IETF standard [Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)](http://cbor.io/).
It supports decoding a packed CBOR value to an unpacked (json) value and
encoding an unpacked (json) value to a packed CBOR value. It also supports a set of operations 
on a `cbor_view` for iterating over and accessing the nested data items of a packed CBOR value.
