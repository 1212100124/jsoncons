- Support [JSON Content Rules v07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arineng/jcr/07/draft-newton-json-content-rules.txt) for schema validation in `jsoncons_ext`

- Enhanced support for stateful allocators

- Add extensions for reading from and serializing to binary formats (bson,bjson,ubjson) 

- Revisit error codes, parsing_context, and opportunities for error recovery. Attempt to support [json 5](http://json5.org/) behaviour through an parse_error_handler and a json_filter.
