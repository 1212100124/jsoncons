0.70 release

- Since 0.50, jsoncons has used snprintf for default serialization of double values to string values. This can result in invalid `json` output (with commas instead of periods) when running on a locale like German or Spanish. This will be fixed.

- Similar issues apply to using std::strtod for deserialization. This will also be fixed.

- Support for legacy compilers without move semantics 

Later releases

- Add support for `basic_json<wchar_t>` (`wjson`), `basic_json_reader<wchar_t>` (`wjson_reader`) etc., initially assuming `utf16`

- Add extensions for reading from and serializing to binary formats (bson,bjson,ubjson)
