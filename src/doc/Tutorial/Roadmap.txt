0.70 release

- Since 0.50, jsoncons has used snprintf for default serialization of double values to string values. This can result in invalid `json` output when running on a locale like German or Spanish. Default double to string conversion is now performed by the method `double_to_string`, which is defined in `jsoncons_config.hpp`.

- Support for legacy compilers without move semantics 

Later releases

- Add support for `basic_json<wchar_t>` (`wjson`), `basic_json_reader<wchar_t>` (`wjson_reader`) etc., initially for 16 bit `wchar_t`

- Add extension for reading from and serializing to binary formats (bson,bjson,ubjson)
